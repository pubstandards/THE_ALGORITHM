# THE ALGORITHM

The Algorithm that decides when Pub Standards is. Never wrong. Always right.

DO NOT QUESTION THE ALGORITHM.

If you would like to become a follower of the Algorithm, [join us](http://london.pubstandards.com). Worship the Algorithm. Give yourself to it once a month.

## No really, what is the Algorithm

* Pub Standards happens on the "middle Thursday" of the month. The middle Thursday is whatever this module says it is.
* Events are numbered sequentially from the first Pub Standards in 2005.
    * Except, there was a hiatus between 2020-2024 for the COVID-19 pandemic, when it was decided that numbering was paused.
    * Provision is made for future hiatuses, let us hope we never have to use it.

## Development

Use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for development:

    uv run pytest .

The [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) formatter/linter is used.
